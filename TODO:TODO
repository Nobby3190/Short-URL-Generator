PROJECTS:
    NAME: "SHORT URL GENERATOR"
    DESCRIPTION: "A SIMPLE URL SHORTENER"
    STATUS: "IN PROGRESS"
    START DATE: "2024-04-09"

FLOW:
    1. User inputs a URL (e.g., www.google.com).
    2. System generates a random hash.
    3. System stores the generated hash and URL in the database.
    4. System stores the key-value pair (hash-URL) in Redis.
    5. When a user queries using the hash, the system first checks Redis for the URL.
    6. If the URL is not found in Redis, the system queries the database.
    7. Simultaneously, the system writes the key-value pair to Redis.

TODOS:
    ☐ Design the database schema.
    ☐ Implement the URL shortening logic.
    ☐ Implement the database and Redis logic.
    ☐ Implement the URL redirection logic.
    ☐ Write tests.
    ☐ Optimize the system for performance.
    ☐ Deploy the system.
